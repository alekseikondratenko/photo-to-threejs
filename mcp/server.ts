/**
 * photo-to-threejs MCP server.
 *
 * The load-bearing fact: an MCP server cannot perform the reconstruction.
 * The modelling is an LLM writing TypeScript across many iterations; the
 * intelligence stays in the host client. This server wraps the method:
 *
 *   deterministic parts -> tools   (measure_reference, score_render)
 *   the method itself   -> prompt  (SKILL.md ships with the server)
 *   the viewer          -> panel   (MCP App) + localhost URL fallback
 *
 * Both acceptance-test runs independently rebuilt exactly these tools mid-run
 * — that convergent reinvention, not optimism, is why these two are the ones
 * shipped. A further meta-finding funds `score_render`: two runs self-scored
 * ~4–8 px with their own rulers and differed 5x under one ruler. Self-scores
 * are not comparable; a standard scorer is.
